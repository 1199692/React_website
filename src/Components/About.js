            Tøyen Unlimited is a neighborhood incubator that supports local enthusiasts with innovative ideas, in solving local social challenges, through the establishment and further operation of income-generating companies with non-profit form and social purposes. TU is thus an investment in place-based social entrepreneurship. 
            Tøyen Unlimited's starting point is that solutions to the challenges in a neighborhood can be found among residents in the local community in question. The incubator was initiated as part of the area lift Tøyen and has since become an independent organization with a location in Aktivitetshuset K1 on Tøyen.
